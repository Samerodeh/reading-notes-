# What is .NET?

***.NET is an open source developer platform, created by Microsoft, for building many different types of applications.***

## .NET

**.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.**

**With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.**

## Languages

**You can write .NET apps in C#, F#, or Visual Basic.**

* C# is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.

* F# is a programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, robust, and performant code.

* Visual Basic is an approachable language with a simple syntax for building type-safe, object-oriented apps.

## Cross Platform

**Whether you're working in C#, F#, or Visual Basic, your code will run natively on any compatible OS. Different .NET implementations handle the heavy lifting for you:**

* .NET Core is a cross-platform .NET implementation for websites, servers, and console apps on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

* .NET Framework supports websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.

* Xamarin/Mono is a .NET implementation for running apps on all the major mobile operating systems.

## One consistent API

**.NET Standard is a base set of APIs that are common to all .NET implementations.**

**Each implementation can also expose additional APIs that are specific to the operating systems it runs on. For example, .NET Framework is a Windows-only .NET implementation that includes APIs for accessing the Windows Registry.**

## Libraries

**To extend functionality, Microsoft and others maintain a healthy package ecosystem built on .NET Standard.**

**NuGet is a package manager built specifically for .NET that contains over 90,000 packages.**

## Application models

**You can build many types of apps with .NET. Some are cross-platform, and some target a specific OS or .NET implementation.**

* Web:

*Build web apps and services for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker.*

* Mobile

*Use a single codebase to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows.*

* Desktop

*Create beautiful and compelling desktop apps for Windows and macOS.*

* Microservices

*Create independently deployable microservices that run on Docker containers.*

* Cloud

*Consume existing cloud services, or create and deploy your own.*

* Machine Learning

*Add vision algorithms, speech processing, predictive models, and more to your apps.*

* Game Development

*Develop 2D and 3D games for the most popular desktops, phones, and consoles.*

* Internet of Things

*Make IoT apps, with native support for the Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers.*

## Active community and open-source

**.NET is open source and under the .NET Foundation. The .NET Foundation is an independent organization to foster open development and collaboration around the .NET ecosystem.**

**Because .NET is open source, you can join the thousands of developers and companies already contributing to the .NET platform.**

## Tools

**The Visual Studio product family provides a great .NET development experience on Windows, Linux, and macOS.**

**The Visual Studio Marketplace has thousands of editor extensions from Microsoft and others.**

**If you prefer to use a different editor, there are .NET command-line tools and plug-ins for many popular editors.**
