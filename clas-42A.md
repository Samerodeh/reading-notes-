# Ethics in the workplace

## The code I’m still ashamed of

> Project Dragonfly, Google’s censored search engine

***Google is experiencing a “moral and ethical” crisis.***

***The existence of the censored search tool — dubbed Dragonfly — was revealed earlier this month by the Intercept, sparking outcry within the company’s ranks and drawing harsh criticism from human rights groups across the world.***

***Only a small group of Google engineers are reportedly developing the platform for Beijing, and information about the project has been so heavily guarded that only a few hundred Google employees even knew about it.***

> Google and AI

***Google will focus on creating “socially beneficial” AI.***

## Ethics in Technology

> Ethical dilemma of self driving cars

***As self-driving technology creeps into vehicles, the debate over how they should behave in situations they can't anticipate is sharpening.***

***No one believes accidents will be eliminated entirely, which brings up an ethical dilemma***

***Human drivers who get into accidents must attempt to make subconscious, split-second moral choices, and often err on the side of protecting themselves, which can result in harm to others. As a result, even in the case of horrifying accidents, we tend to cut them some slack.***

***Self-driving cars will also introduce new forms of human control. Not having to own a vehicle and hiring one only when it's needed will itself be a major new form – one that will likely give many people more control over their monthly finances. Passengers are also likely to have more choice over vehicle settings, preferences and routes, not to mention what they do while they're in the car.***

> Cyber-Security of self driving cars 

***Ten million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020, according to an in-depth report by Business Insider Intelligence.***

***In principle, any computerized system that has an interface to the outside world is potentially hackable. Any computer scientist knows that it is very difficult to create software without any bugs—especially when the software is very complex. Bugs may sometimes be security vulnerabilities, and may be exploitable.***

***As a result, car manufacturers, like other industries, are trying to come up with defense techniques that can prevent attacks against their systems.***

## Tech Company Principles

> Microsoft AI Principles

***put responsible AI principles into practice through the Office of Responsible AI (ORA), the AI, Ethics, and Effects in Engineering and Research (Aether) Committee, and Responsible AI Strategy in Engineering (RAISE).  The Aether Committee advises our leadership on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI innovations. ORA sets our rules and governance processes, working closely with teams across the company to enable the effort. RAISE is a team that enables the implementation of Microsoft responsible AI rules across engineering groups.***

> Ethical OS Toolkit

***As technologists, it’s only natural that we spend most of our time focusing on how our tech will change the world for the better.***
