# Images

> Choosing Images for Your Site

***A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.*** 

> Adding Images 

* (img)

*To add an image into the page
you need to use an (img)
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:*

1. src

*This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site.*

2. alt

*This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.*

#### Example : 

(img src="" alt="")

* All elements write between <>

> Three Rules for Creating Images

1. Save images in the right format.

2. Save images at the right size.

3. Use the correct resolution. 

# Color 

***Color can really bring your pages to life.***

> Foreground Color

* color

*The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:* 

1. rgb values 

*These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)* 

2. hex codes

*These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80*

3. color names

*There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan* 

* background-color  

*CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.* 

# Text 

> Typeface Terminology 

1. Serif

Serif fonts have extra details on
the ends of the main strokes of
the letters. These details are
known as serifs. 

In print, serif fonts were
traditionally used for long
passages of text because they
were considered easier to read.

2. Sans-Serif

Sans-serif fonts have straight
ends to letters, and therefore
have a much cleaner design.

Screens have a lower resolution
than print. So, if the text is small,
sans-serif fonts can be clearer
to read.

3. Monospace

Every letter in a monospace (or
fixed-width) font is the same
width. (Non-monospace fonts
have different widths.)

Monospace fonts are commonly
used for code because they align
nicely, making the text easier to
follow. 

* Weight 

**The font weight not only adds
emphasis but can also affect
the amount of white space and
contrast on a page.**

* Style 

**Italic fonts have a cursive aspect
to some of the lettering. Oblique
font styles take the normal style
and put it on an angle.** 

* Stretch 

**In condensed (or narrow)
versions of the font, letters are
thinner and closer together.
In expanded versions they are
thicker and further apart.** 

> Specifying Typefaces 

* font-family 

*The font-family property
allows you to specify the
typeface that should be used for
any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.* 

> Size of type 

*The font-size property enables
you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to
specify the size of a font. The
most common are:* 

1. pixels 
2. percentages 
3. ems 

> Bold

* font-weight

**The font-weight property
allows you to create bold text.** 

> Italic 

* font-style 

*If you want to create italic text,
you can use the font-style
property.* 

> text-transform 

1. uppercase

This causes the text to appear
uppercase.

2. lowercase

This causes the text to appear
lowercase. 

3. capitalize

This causes the first letter of
each word to appear capitalized.

> Alignment 

* text-align 

*The text-align property allows
you to control the alignment of
text. The property can take one
of four values:* 

1. left

This indicates that the text
should be left-aligned.

2. right

This indicates that the text
should be right-aligned.

3. center

This allows you to center text. 

4. justify

This indicates that every line in
a paragraph, except the last line,
should be set to take up the full
width of the containing box.

# JPEG  

## TL;DR 

***Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.***
