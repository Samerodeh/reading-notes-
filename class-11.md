### Images  

> Controlling sizes of images in CSS 

**You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.** 

![size images](https://slideplayer.com/slide/15265880/92/images/4/CONTROLLING+SIZES+OF+IMAGES+USING+CSS.jpg)

> Aligning images Using CSS 

**Rather than using the (img)
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:**


* The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image

* New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.

> Centering images Using CSS 

**By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel
element using the display
property with a value of block.**

![center images](https://slideplayer.com/slide/15265880/92/images/20/CENTERING+IMAGES+USING+CSS.jpg)

> background-image 

**The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.**

> background-repeat 

* repeat

*The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically*

* repeat-x

*The image is repeated
horizontally only*

* repeat-y

*The image is repeated vertically
only.*

* no-repeat

*The image is only shown once.*

**The background-attachment
property specifies whether a
background image should stay in
one position or move as the user
scrolls up and down the page. It
can have one of two values:**

* fixed

*The background image stays in
the same position on the page.*

* scroll

*The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.*

> background-position 

**When an image is not being
repeated, you can use the
background-position
property to specify where in the
browser window the background
image should be placed.** 

* left top
* left center
* left bottom
* center top
* center center
* center bottom
* right top
* right center
* right bottom

> Gradients 

**The
gradient is created using the
background-image property
and, at the time of writing,
different browsers required a
different syntax.** 

> Contrast of background images

**If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low
contrast in order for the text to be legible.**

* Hi gh Contrast

*The majority of photographs
have quite a high contrast, which
means that they are not ideal for
use as a background image.*

* Low Contrast

*Image editing applications such
as Photoshop and GIMP have
tools that allow you to manually
adjust your images to have lower
contrast.*

* Screen 

*To overlay text on an image with
high contrast, you can place a
semi-transparent background
color (or "screen") behind the
text to improve legibility.*

### Practical Information 

> Search Engine Optimization (SEO ) 

* The Basics 

*Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.*  

* On-Page Techniques 

*On-Page Techniques
On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines.*

* Off-Page Techniques

*Getting other sites to link to you
is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help
determine how to rank your
site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.* 

> On-Page SEO 

**In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.** 

1. Page Title 

The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the (title) element which lives
inside the (head) element. 

2. URL / Web Address

The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name. 

3. Headings

If the keywords are in a heading
(hn) element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text. 

4. Text

Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read. 

5. Link Text

Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here"). 

6. Image Alt Text

Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.

7. Page Descriptions

The description also lives inside
the (head) element and is
specified using a (meta) tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the results
pages of search engines.) 

> How to Identify Keywords and Phrases 

**Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.** 

1. Brainstorm 

List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site.  

2. Organize 

Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.

3. Research 

There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to
consider. 

4. Compare 

Some of the keyword research sites can tell you how many
people have searched for a specific keyword to help you
know how much competition those terms have. 

5. Refine 

need to pick which keywords you will focus on.

6. MAP 

Pick 3-5 keywords or phrases that map to each page of your
website and use these as the keywords for each page. 

> Analytics: Learning about your Visitors 

**people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics.**

> Domain Names & Hosting 

* DOMAIN NAMES 

*Your domain name is your web
address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
co.uk). There are many websites
that allow you to register domain
names. Usually you will have to
pay an annual fee to keep that
domain name.* 

* WEB HOSTING 

*So that other people can see
your site, you will need to upload
it to a web server. Web servers
are special computers that are
constantly connected to the
Internet. They are specially set
up to serve web pages when
they are requested.*

> FTP & Third Party Tools

**To transfer your code and images from your
computer to your hosting company, you use
something known as File Transfer Protocol.**

### Video and Audio APIs

**HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — (video) and (audio) — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback**


> HTML5 video and audio

*The (video) and (audio) elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages.*
> The HTMLMediaElement API

*Part of the HTML5 spec, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically*
