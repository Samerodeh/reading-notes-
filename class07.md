# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team 

***our data-saturated age***

**enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves. ‘‘We’re living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity,’’ says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University who studies how people share information.**

***project Aristotle’s researchers*** 

**No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference.** 

***‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’***  

# How I explained REST to my brother 

### Who is Roy Fielding ? 

* ***He's smart guy.He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.*** 

### Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world ? 

* ***Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.*** 

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created ?

* ***is used to get pages from servers to your browser is that first part tells the browser what protocol to use.*** 

* ***That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.***

* ***it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.*** 

* ***It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.***

* ***it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.*** 

### What does a GET do ? 

* ***Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET*** 

### What does a POST do ? 

* ***If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST*** 

### What does PUT do ? 

* ***If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT*** 

### What does PATCH do ? 

* ***to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH***
