# HTML & CSS 

>## Introducing

***CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page.***

### CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements:

* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. 

1. Selectors

*indicate which
element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas.*

2. Declarations 

*indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.*

### How Elements Are Displayed ?

* CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

1. Properties 

*indicate the aspects
of the element you want to
change. For example, color, font,
width, height and border.* 

2. Values 

*specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen
properties. For example, if you
want to specify a color property
then the value is the color you
want the text in these elements
to be.*

### HOW Using External CSS ?

> #### link 

**The (link) element can be used
in an HTML document to tell the
browser where to find the CSS
file used to style the page. It is an
empty element (meaning it does
not need a closing tag), and it
lives inside the <head> element.
It should use three attributes:**

> 1. href

*This specifies the path to the
CSS file (which is often placed in
a folder called css or styles).*

> 2. type

*This attribute specifies the type
of document being linked to. The
value should be text/css*.

> 3. rel 

*This specifies the relationship
between the HTML page and
the file it is linked to. The value
should be styleshee*

### HOW Usi ng Internal CSS ?

#### (style)

**You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing
them inside a (style) element,
which usually sits inside the
(head) element of the page.** 

|   Selector  |   Meaning  |
|-------------|------------|
| Type Selector      | Matches element names.            |
| Class Selector     | Matches an element whose class attribute has a value that mathces the one specified after the period (or full stop) symbol.       |
| ID Selector        |  matches an element whose id attribute has a value that mathces the one specified after the pound or hash symbol. | 
|           |

> ## HTML & CSS Color 
***The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:***

* rgb values

*These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)* 

* hex codes

*These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80*

* color names

*There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan*
