# What is the infographic

***Infographics are graphic visual representations of information, data, or knowledge intended to present information quickly and clearly. They can improve cognition by utilizing graphics to enhance the human visual system's ability to see patterns and trends.***

# Two Different Types of Infographics

* > Traditional Infographic:

*A traditional infographic is a visual image that summarizes a complex problem and breaks it down into easy to comprehend sections.*

* > Action-Based Infographic:

*An action-based infographic is much more of a blueprint. Itâ€™s a single page plan of action to solve a complex problem broken down into an easy to follow step-by-step plan.* 

# Design Elements of a Great Infographic

**Great infographics come in different forms and sizes.  An amazing infographic could be as simple as a 5 column bar chart. Or it can be as elaborate as a year-long business plan broken down by month and category.**

# Where to Market the Infographics

**The best place to market the infographics is the place where the audience hangs out:**

* Pinterest is a visual search engine and is a fantastic place to market the infographic.

* Twitter or LinkedIn is a great place to promote the smaller, more traditional infographics.
