## Scripts

### WRITING A SCRIPT

> To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps

1. DEFINE THE GOAL

*you need to define the task you want to achieve* 

2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 

*To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart.
You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow.* 

3. CODE EACH STEP

*Each of the steps needs to be written in a
programming language that the computer understands.*


## Expressions + Operators 

>* Expressions 

*An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.*

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE 


>* Operators

*Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.*


## Functions 

***Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task.***
