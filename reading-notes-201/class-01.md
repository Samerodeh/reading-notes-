# Html 

## Chapter 8

>HTML 4
Released 1997 

**Although HTML 4 had some
presentational elements to
control the appearance of pages,
authors are not recommended to
use them any more. (Examples
include the {{center}} element
for centering content on a
page, {{font}} for controlling
the appearance of text, and
strike to put a line through
the text — all of these can be
achieved with CSS instead.)** 
 >XHTML 1.0
Released 2000

**In 1998, a language called XML
was published. Its purpose
was to allow people to write
new markup languages. Since
HTML was the most widely used
markup language around, it was
decided that HTML 4 should be
reformulated to follow the rules
of XML and it was renamed
XHTML. This meant that
authors had to follow some new,
more strict rules about writing
markup.** 

>HTML5
Released 2000

**In HTML5, web page authors do
not need to close all tags, and
new elements and attributes will
be introduced. At the time of
writing, the HTML5 specification
had not been completed, but
the major browser makers had
started to implement many of
the new features, and web page
authors were rapidly adopting
the new markup.
Despite the fact that HTML5
is not yet completed, you can
safely take advantage of the
new features of the language as
long as you endeavour to ensure
that users with older browsers
will be able to view your pages
(even though some of the extra
features will not be visible to
them).** 

## Chapter 17

>New Html5 Layout
Elements 

**HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page.** 

## Chapter 18

>Who is the Site For?

**Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.**

> WireFrames

**A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.**  

# JavaScript 

## The ABC of Programming 

>A What is a script and how do I create one ?

**A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.**

### WRITING A SCRIPT 

**To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it** 

1. DEFINE THE GOAL
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3. CODE EACH STEP 

>B How do computers fit in with the world around them ?

* Computers use data to create models of things in the real world.
The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other:
Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an
object's properties.

>C How do I write a script for a web page ? 

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

* The HTML (script) element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the (link) element can be used to load a CSS file).

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
